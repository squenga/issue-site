			<h2 class="subTitle">OVERVIEW</h2>
		
			<p class="infoBox">For decades, the Indigenous CHamoru people of Guam have been losing more and more ancestral land to the U.S. military. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Guam has seen a loss of its culture, ways of life, and most importantly, its ancestral land. Situated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with an area of 30 miles long and 9 miles wide, the island of Guam relies on its land as a scarce resource that preserves the cultural and social stability of the CHamoru people. As of right now, they own less than one-third of the island. CHamoru culture itself is on the brink of extinction. Ancestral lands must be returned now. Enough is enough.</p>
